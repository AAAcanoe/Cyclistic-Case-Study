## Overview
This is the Cyclistic Case Study I performed through the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project. I am interested in this project because this is my first case study in the field of data analytics. From this case study, I was able to use the skills I learned to generate insights and tell a story from huge amounts of data. I am looking forward to performing more case studies in the future.

## Scenario
In the Cyclistic company, I am a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team. Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago that provides various types of bikes to users. Cyclistic's customers could be categorized into casual riders and Cyclistic members. Casual riders are customers who purchased single-ride or full-day passes whereas Cyclistic members are customers who purchased annual memberships.

The director of the marketing analyst team believes that maximizing the amount of Cyclistic members would contribute to the company's future success, therfore the team needs to understand how casual riders and Cyclistic members differ. I was assigned the following question by the director: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

## Procedure
In order to solve this question, I followed the procedure of analyzing data, which is "Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act". I first defined the business task I needed to solve, then prepare the data by downloading datasets from a source that is reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited (ROCCC). After preparing the data, I processed the data by cleaning it, and then perform analysis on the data by filtering it based on what I am interested in finding. When the insights are generated and supported by data visualizations, I will share these results with the stakeholders. At the end, I will make recommendations based on the trends of the data in order to solve the problem.
